## 👨‍🔬 About Me
I am a Junior Researcher passionate about landscape ecology, agricultural land use change, data analysis, and soil modelling. My work at the Institute of Alpine Environment (Eurac Research) focuses on understanding how landscapes evolve and how data-driven insights can foster sustainable development.

## 🧰 Tech Toolkit

- **Programming Languages:** R, Python  
- **Other Languages:** C99, JavaScript, Haskell, ARM, HTML, PostgreSQL

## 🚀 Projects
Most of my programming is purpose-built for internal research or private datasets, so you won't find many public repositories—yet! Stay tuned for future open science contributions.
